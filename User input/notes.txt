To take input from user, there are 2 ways:
1. Process.argv
	This just provides an array of cmd arguments and can be accessed using offset as in an array
	the problem is when the number of variables is increased, this causes a problem as offset is not fixed. Also depending on user config of node, offset might change

2. Using yargs
	Provides key-value pairs of arguments. 
	Flags (--x) can be used to create key and = after flag will add value to the key.
